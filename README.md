# subreddit-grabber

For some reason, you want to download all of the top-level posts of a subreddit, and store them in a mysql database.  Well you're in luck, pal, because that's what this crappy little script does!  Enjoy!  Abundanza!  Huzzah!

* copy subreddit-grabber.cfg.SAMPLE to subreddit-grabber.cfg, and edit that file to specify the subreddit you want to grab, mysql credentials, etc.

* If you're using Ubuntu, the install-on-ubuntu.sh script should help you to ensure that all prerequisite packages and python modules are installed.
